# Botnet-DDos-attack-detection-using-machine-learning-algorithm
The ultimate aim of this project is to create a robust and accurate DDoS attack detection system using machine learning algorithms that can contribute to enhancing the security and resilience of networks against such cyber threats.
In my project DDoS attack detection using various machine learning algorithms, including SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Random Forest, on a dataset read from the file "final-dataset.arff." The dataset is preprocessed to balance the classes and then split into training and testing subsets. The methodology for DDoS attack detection using the code give in file.
